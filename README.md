Experimental design on diabetes dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

Introduction

By delivering the right and available facts and performing analytic doings, Machine Learning
structures can contribute to making good verdicts. You must guarantee that the dataset is as
clean and interpretable using a set of choices that well-matches with the data arrangements used
in your secured and embraced capabilities you possess. The output, whether prediction or any
other result, offer you direction to the decision-making process. When you make rulings built on
statistics from information arrangements, you're reflecting data from your firms' activities. The
information recorded at the job level is organized into multiple setups by the strategic structures.


Objective

Many researchers have conducted various studies on this dataset and have gained many insights
into areas diabetes prediction. However, the objective of this experiment is not a thoroughly
study on the dataset, but it will serve as a good case study for us to apply and learn various
machine learning methods on. Although many researchers have annotated this dataset for their
research and most of them are available for public use. Not much processing was done by me in
order to gain the insights I seek, which are mentioned in coming sections.
